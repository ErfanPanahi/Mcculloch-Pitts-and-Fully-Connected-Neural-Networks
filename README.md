# Mcculloch-Pitts-and-Fully-Connected-Neural-Networks
In this repository, I want to implement several Fully Connected Neural Networks and demonstrate one of the applications of the McCulloch-Pitts neural network.

## **<span style="color:red">Question 1.</span>** Mcculloch-Pitts Neural Networks *<span style="color:cyan">(Deterministic Finite Automaton - DFA)</span>*

In this question, we aim to first become familiar with **deterministic finite automaton (DFA)** and then design a **neural network** for it. [![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open-blue)](https://github.com/ErfanPanahi/Mcculloch-Pitts-and-Fully-Connected-Neural-Networks/tree/main/Q1)
