# Mcculloch-Pitts-and-Fully-Connected-Neural-Networks
In this repository, I want to implement several Fully Connected Neural Networks and demonstrate one of the applications of the McCulloch-Pitts neural network.

## **Question 1.** Mcculloch-Pitts Neural Networks 

In this question, we aim to first become familiar with **deterministic finite automaton (DFA)** and then design a **neural network** for it. [![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open-blue)](https://github.com/ErfanPanahi/Mcculloch-Pitts-and-Fully-Connected-Neural-Networks/tree/main/Q1)

## **Question 2.** AdaLine and MAdaLine Neural Networks

In this question, we will become familiar with the **AdaLine** and **MadaLine** networks. [![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open-grey)](https://github.com/ErfanPanahi/Mcculloch-Pitts-and-Fully-Connected-Neural-Networks/tree/main/Q2)

## **Question 3.** Auto-Encoders for Classification

In this question, we want to solve a classification problem using an **Auto-Encoder**.

## **Question 4.** Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks

In this question, I will use a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** network to predict prices [`CarPrice_Assignment.csv`](https://github.com/ErfanPanahi/Mcculloch-Pitts-and-Fully-Connected-Neural-Networks/blob/main/Q4/CarPrice_Assignment.csv) and compare the predictions with the actual prices.
